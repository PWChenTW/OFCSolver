And initialize royalty scoring system
And set fantasy land qualification rules
```

#### Scenario: Validate Hand Rankings
```gherkin
Given I have placed cards in my OFC layout
When I complete my hand arrangement

And calculate standard poker hand rankings correctly
```

#### Scenario: Handle Fantasy Land Rules
```gherkin
Given I am in a regular OFC round
When I make a qualifying hand (QQ+ in top, trips+ in middle, straight+ in bottom)
Then the system should identify fantasy land qualification
And prepare for next round fantasy land play
And apply correct fantasy land card distribution rules
```

### Feature: Strategy Calculation and GTO Solving

#### Scenario: Calculate Optimal Card Placement
```gherkin
Given I have a specific OFC position with known cards
And I have multiple placement options for the next card

And recommend the highest EV placement
And provide confidence intervals for the recommendation
```

#### Scenario: Multi-Player Position Analysis
```gherkin
Given I am in a 3-player OFC game
And I can see some opponent cards based on game state
When I request position analysis
Then the system should consider all players' positions
And calculate optimal strategy against multiple opponents
And account for card removal effects
And provide strategy recommendations with opponent modeling
```

#### Scenario: End Game Solver
```gherkin
Given I am in the final placement rounds of an OFC hand
And most cards have been dealt
When I need to make final placement decisions
Then the system should perform exhaustive analysis
And calculate exact expected values for all scenarios
And recommend optimal play with mathematical certainty
And show probability distributions for all outcomes
```

### Feature: Hand Analysis and Review

#### Scenario: Import Hand History
```gherkin
Given I have completed an OFC hand

And reconstruct the decision points throughout the hand
And identify all placement decisions made
And prepare for detailed analysis
```

#### Scenario: Analyze Suboptimal Decisions
```gherkin
Given I have imported a completed hand
When I run the analysis engine

And highlight decisions that deviated from optimal
And quantify the EV loss for each mistake
And provide explanations for why alternatives were better
```

#### Scenario: Generate Improvement Recommendations

And provide immediate feedback on my choices
And track my performance over time in this scenario type
```

#### Scenario: Adaptive Training Difficulty
```gherkin
Given I have been practicing OFC scenarios
